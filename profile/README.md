## Hey 👋

VTP (Vibe Transfer Protocol) is a platform for deploying and running personal apps. Think of it as an app store for the little tools you actually use every day — sourdough timers, vinyl trackers, habit loggers, that kind of thing.

Built for vibe coders. The people making cool stuff with Claude Code, Cursor and Windsurf but who'd rather not deal with servers, Docker, DNS or any of that nonsense.

**You build it. We run it. Your data stays yours.**

### What's here
